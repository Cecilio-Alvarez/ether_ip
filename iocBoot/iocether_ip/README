To run the example application on Linux,
check the startup file st.cmd.host
to check that the IP of the PLC is correct
and that the loaded database has any resemblance
of what's on the PLC.
Then do something like this:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../../lib/linux-x86:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH;
 ../../bin/linux-x86/example st.cmd.host
